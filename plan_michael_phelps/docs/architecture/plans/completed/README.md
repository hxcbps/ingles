# Completed Plans Archive

Last reviewed: 2026-02-12
Status: active

Move execution plans from `../active/` to this folder only when all validation checklists are complete and debt deltas are recorded.

Naming convention:

- Keep original file name (`EXEC-*.md`).
- Add closure metadata in the file:
  - `Closed: YYYY-MM-DD`
  - `Closure commit: <sha>`
