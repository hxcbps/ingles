# S8 Agent Prompt Library - Design Factory Wave 2

Date: 2026-02-12

## S8-DF2-01 Palette

"Open `design_factory/packages/palette/palette.css`. Expand semantic color governance with strict token hierarchy and legacy bridges. Do not add extra accent families."

## S8-DF2-02 Typography

"Open `design_factory/packages/typography/typography.css`. Align display/headline/body/label roles and utility mappings; remove ad-hoc scale drift."

## S8-DF2-03 Buttons

"Open `design_factory/packages/buttons/buttons.css`. Enforce primary/secondary/ghost hierarchy and full interaction states including focus-visible and loading."

## S8-DF2-04 Motion

"Open `design_factory/packages/motion/motion.css`. Keep motion purposeful and ensure reduced-motion fallback disables non-essential animations."

## S8-DF2-05 Story

"Open `design_factory/packages/story/story.css` and `app/web/js/ui/learning_shell.js`. Ensure shell, hero, widgets, wizard, and module cards share one coherent language."

## S8-DF2-06 Integration

"Rebuild `design_factory/dist/factory.css` and `app/web/css/factory.css` via `scripts/build_design_factory_css.sh`. Update status docs and verify mandatory quality gates."
