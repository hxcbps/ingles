# Sprint 7 Figma Frontend Reboot - Execution Status Wave 1

Date: 2026-02-12
Scope source: `guides/backlog/agents/S7_AGENT_ASSIGNMENT_FIGMA_WAVE1.md`

## Summary

- Execution mode: parallel lanes with non-overlapping ownership.
- Lanes completed: `0/8`.
- Current phase: `Plan and design artifact generation`.

## Lane Evidence

| Lane | Scope | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| `S7-FG-01` | North Star | Pending |
| `S7-FG-02` | Navigation IA | Pending |
| `S7-FG-03` | Desktop screens | Pending |
| `S7-FG-04` | Mobile screens | Pending |
| `S7-FG-05` | Components and tokens | Pending |
| `S7-FG-06` | States and feedback | Pending |
| `S7-FG-07` | Prototype journeys | Pending |
| `S7-FG-08` | Dev handoff | Pending |

## Validation

- Planning artifacts versioned: `pass`
- Figma implementation wave: `not started`

## Residual Risks

- Visual consistency debt persists until Figma artifacts are approved and implemented.
- CTA hierarchy and navigation discoverability still depend on Wave 2 implementation.
