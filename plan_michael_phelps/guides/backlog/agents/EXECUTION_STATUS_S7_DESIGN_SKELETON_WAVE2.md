Date: 2026-02-12
Scope source: `guides/backlog/agents/S7_AGENT_ASSIGNMENT_DESIGN_SKELETON_WAVE2.md`

## Summary

- Execution mode: specialist lanes executed and merged.
- Lanes completed: `5/5`.
- Current phase: `unified design merge delivered`.

## Lane Evidence

| Lane | Scope | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| `S7-DS-01` | Palette system | Done (`docs/design/figma/wave2/S7-W2-01_PALETTE_SYSTEM.md`) |
| `S7-DS-02` | Button system | Done (`docs/design/figma/wave2/S7-W2-02_BUTTON_MATRIX.md`) |
| `S7-DS-03` | Typography system | Done (`docs/design/figma/wave2/S7-W2-03_TYPOGRAPHY_SCALE.md`) |
| `S7-DS-04` | Motion audit | Done (`docs/design/figma/wave2/S7-W2-04_MOTION_SCORECARD.md`) |
| `S7-DS-05` | Color storytelling review | Done (`docs/design/figma/wave2/S7-W2-05_COLOR_STORY_MAP.md`) |

## Merge Artifact

- `docs/design/figma/wave2/S7-W2-06_UNIFIED_DESIGN_MERGE.md`

## Validation

- Architecture docs lint: pass
- Docs drift check: pass
- Runtime tests: pass
- Frontend UX gates: pass (color hardcode warning still open)

## Residual Risks

- Hard-coded color debt remains and must be reduced in Wave 3 implementation.
- Figma-native frame execution still requires direct collaboration in your Figma workspace.
