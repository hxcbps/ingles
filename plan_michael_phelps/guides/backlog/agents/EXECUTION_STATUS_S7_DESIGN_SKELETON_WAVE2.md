# Sprint 7 Design Skeleton - Execution Status Wave 2

Date: 2026-02-12
Scope source: `guides/backlog/agents/S7_AGENT_ASSIGNMENT_DESIGN_SKELETON_WAVE2.md`

## Summary

- Execution mode: parallel lanes with non-overlapping ownership.
- Lanes completed: `0/5`.
- Current phase: `specialist design definition`.

## Lane Evidence

| Lane | Scope | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| `S7-DS-01` | Palette system | Pending |
| `S7-DS-02` | Button system | Pending |
| `S7-DS-03` | Typography system | Pending |
| `S7-DS-04` | Motion audit | Pending |
| `S7-DS-05` | Color storytelling review | Pending |

## Validation

- Planning artifacts versioned: `pass`
- Specialist execution: `not started`

## Residual Risks

- Visual inconsistency persists until lanes finish and merge into a unified system.
- Overrides can drift without final token governance from lane `S7-DS-01`.
